      <h2>Welcome to the Future of Family Holidays</h2>
      <p>
        We’re Stuart and Lina, the proud “mum and dad” team behind Blue Mountains Smart Homes, located in beautiful Katoomba, Blue Mountains. Our mission? To bring a little bit of tomorrow to your holiday today—without losing the warmth, comfort, and fun of a true family getaway.

      <h3>Who Are We?</h3>
      <p>
  We’re not a faceless corporation—we’re a family, just like yours! We’ve poured our hearts (and a few late-night cups of tea) into creating two of the most unique holiday homes in Katoomba, Blue Mountains. We look after our homes directly—no middle people, no agencies—so you always get a personal touch and genuine care from the owners themselves. Our homes are packed with smart features, from voice-controlled lighting and climate to entertainment systems that even the kids can master (with a little help from Google).
      </p>
      <p>
  We believe holidays should be easy, fun, and a little bit magical. That’s why we’ve written detailed, friendly house manuals—so you can spend less time figuring out the tech and more time relaxing in the spa, watching a movie, or exploring the World Heritage wilderness just outside your door. (And don’t worry—if the house starts talking back, it’s just Google saying hi!)

        <li><strong>Personal Touch:</strong> We greet every guest personally (or virtually!), and our manuals are written with a smile and a wink. If you can’t find the popcorn button, just call—we’ve got you covered.</li>
        <li><strong>All Ages Welcome:</strong> Whether you’re 8 or 80, you’ll find something to love. Our homes are designed for families, couples, and friends who want a little extra wow in their holiday.</li>
