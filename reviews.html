Only suggestion to the host is to close the top window in the ensuite during winter as the bathroom got really cold. Since we were only there for one night, we only closed the blinds to minimise the winter draft coming in.</div></div></div>
      <div class="review"><div class="review-avatar">S</div><div class="review-content"><div class="review-header"><span class="review-name">Son</span><span class="review-rating">★★★★★</span><span class="review-date">June 2025</span></div><div class="review-body">We had a wonderful stay at the Smart Retreat! The place was clean, well-maintained, and thoughtfully set up for families. We especially appreciated the handy selection of kids’ toys, board games, a TV, and a projector, which made relaxing together easy and enjoyable. Comfort features like the reclining couch, electric blankets, and a well-equipped kitchen added to the homely feel. The smart home setup with voice-activated controls was a fun and modern bonus. While a few devices had low batteries, it wasn’t a major inconvenience. A couple of things to keep in mind: the entrance has stairs, so it may not suit those with limited mobility, and the driveway is sloped, which could be a concern for low-clearance vehicles — but there’s ample street parking nearby. Stuart was very friendly and prompt in responding to our questions. Overall, it was a great retreat and a very comfortable family stay.</div></div></div>

This is a one of a kind accommodation with voice assistance technology everywhere.

The smart voice activated devices for the tap in the kitchen was rather maddening after a while. Dedicated work space was really apparent and then not comfortable. But it was an experience and thought provoking. This has given a better appreciation of unplugged devices.</div></div></div>
