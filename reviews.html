Only suggestion to the host is to close the top window in the ensuite during winter as the bathroom got really cold. Since we were only there for one night, we only closed the blinds to minimise the winter draft coming in.</div></div></div>
<div class="review"><div class="review-avatar">S</div><div class="review-content"><div class="review-header"><span class="review-name">Son</span><span class="review-rating">★★★★★</span><span class="review-date">June 2025</span></div><div class="review-body">We had a wonderful stay at the Smart Retreat! The place was clean, well-maintained, and thoughtfully set up for families. We especially appreciated the handy selection of kids’ toys, board games, a TV, and a projector, which made relaxing together easy and enjoyable. Comfort features like the reclining couch, electric blankets, and a well-equipped kitchen added to the homely feel. The smart home setup with voice-activated controls was a fun and modern bonus. While a few devices had low batteries, it wasn’t a major inconvenience. A couple of things to keep in mind: the entrance has stairs, so it may not suit those with limited mobility, and the driveway is sloped, which could be a concern for low-clearance vehicles — but there’s ample street parking nearby. Stuart was very friendly and prompt in responding to our questions. Overall, it was a great retreat and a very comfortable family stay.</div></div></div>

We loved the home theatre experience, would have been better if all the recliner chairs were working though. But apart from that, well equipped home, we were able to cook a hearty meal. Bathtub with the jaccuzi was a plus! Overall totally worth the money paid</div></div></div>
<div class="review"><div class="review-avatar">S</div><div class="review-content"><div class="review-header"><span class="review-name">Sonia</span><span class="review-location">Cecil Park, Australia</span><span class="review-rating">★★★★★</span><span class="review-date">February 2025</span></div><div class="review-body">Thank you for a wonderful stay in your home</div></div></div>

Saying "Hey Google, turn off all the lights" during the night while someone is in the shower is especially fun.<br><br>The place was great and really private, you'll need a car to get easily to the city centre. Otherwise there is a clockwise loop bus route that runs every 20-30 mins which runs to the Three Sisters Lookout and the city centre.<br><br>I'd definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone who has a large group and needs a place to stay.</div></div></div>
<div class="review"><div class="review-avatar">E</div><div class="review-content"><div class="review-header"><span class="review-name">Elizabeth</span><span class="review-location">Colorado Springs, CO</span><span class="review-rating">★★★★★</span><span class="review-date">February 2025</span></div><div class="review-body">I have only great things to say about this place! My friends and I loved staying here, great kitchen — gas stove, huge grill, and all the kitchen utensils we could have imagined! Comfortable beds and a fun movie night with the projector. Even when our car wouldn’t start, Stuart came over within 20 minutes to help jump it. Genuinely the best Airbnb and hospitality experiences that I have ever had, would stay here again in a heartbeat!</div></div></div>

Something you would envision your dream home to be. Stuart is very responsive and check-in process was smooth. Wished we had more time to enjoy the bath tub as it looked so inviting! We definitely had fun playing with the Google minis which are everywhere, from turning on music to lights and even controlling the showers! That was definitely an amazing experience. Very well equipped for cooking in too. Recommended for 2 nights stay at least to truly enjoy the home. Only caution is the entrance if you are driving a large car, coming in from opposite lane can be abit challenging due to the slope.</div></div></div>
